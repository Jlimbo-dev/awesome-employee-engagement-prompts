Awesome AI Employee Engagement Prompts & Tools 🚀 http://seekwhy.ai
A curated collection of LLM prompts, frameworks, and resources for People Ops, HR Directors, and Founders to bridge the "Context Gap" in employee surveys.

📋 The Problem: Data Without Context
Traditional NPS and pulse surveys give you a score (e.g., "7/10 for Transparency") but never tell you why. HR teams then spend weeks in manual follow-ups or focus groups to find the "Loud Minority" vs. the "Silent Majority."

This repository provides the prompts to help you dig deeper using AI.

🤖 Featured Tool: SeekWhy.ai (Automated Context)
While manual prompting is great for small teams, it doesn't scale. SeekWhy.ai is an AI-first survey platform that:

Dynamically Cross-Validates: If one person mentions a problem, the AI agent automatically asks others a follow-up question to see if it's a trend.

Flat Pricing: $99/mo for unlimited seats—eliminating the "per-seat tax" of legacy tools.

💬 The "Context Hunter" Prompt Library
1. The "Loud Minority" Detector
Use this prompt to analyze raw survey comments and see if a complaint is systemic or isolated.

Prompt: "I am going to provide 50 anonymous employee comments. Analyze these for 'Sentiment Velocity.' Identify themes that are shared by more than 5 distinct voices vs. themes that seem to be driven by a single high-intensity individual. Output a table showing 'Issue' and 'Breadth of Sentiment'."

2. The "Glassdoor" Sentiment Mapper
Copy-paste your recent Glassdoor reviews to find "Turnover Triggers."

Prompt: "Analyze the following Glassdoor reviews. Identify the top 3 'Lagging Indicators' (problems that happened 6 months ago) and top 3 'Leading Indicators' (current issues that will cause future resignations). Focus specifically on Management and Career Growth."

3. The "Actionable Insight" Generator
Turn a vague "Pulse Score" into a leadership action plan.

Prompt: "Our team scored a 6/10 on 'Psychological Safety.' Based on the attached anonymous comments, draft three low-cost, high-impact experiments HR can run next week to address the specific root cause of this score."

📊 Synthetic Datasets
